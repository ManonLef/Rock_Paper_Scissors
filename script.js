//Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. 
//The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - 
//and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
//Make your functionâ€™s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation)
